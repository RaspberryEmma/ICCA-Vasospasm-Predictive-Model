# ICCA-Vasospasm-Predictive-Model

We seek to develop a predictive model for Vasospasm using the existing ICCA data-set.

This is a project conducted in collaboration with Southmead Hospital Bristol, building on prior work done by McWilliams et al. (https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1460, https://github.com/UHBristolDataScience/ICNARC-to-Philips-Linkage) in 2019.

In accordance with NDA, all data is expunged.  As such, this model is provided "code only" alongside regression coefficients.  As with the previous work we build from, we invite external researchers to request access to the data via formal research ethics approval.

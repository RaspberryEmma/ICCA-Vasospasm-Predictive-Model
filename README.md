# ICCA-Vasospasm-Predictive-Model
This is a project conducted in collaboration with Southmead Hospital Bristol, building on prior work done by McWilliams et al. (https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1460) in 2019.
We seek to develop a predictive model for Vasospasm using the existing ICCA data-set.
